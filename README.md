### Building on Linux

#### Dependencies:

- go >= 1.9
- zcashd = 2.0.2
- 2.8.0 <= redis-server <= 4.0.12
- 4 LTS <= nodejs <= 10 LTS
- nginx

**Highly recomended Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS.** You can try other versions, but we don't take responsibility.

#### Clone OZP repository, compile equihash lib & pool

```sh
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/JKKGBE/open-zcash-pool.git
$ cd open-zcash-pool/equihash/libs
$ make
$ cd ../..
$ make
```

#### Install redis-server

```sh
$ cd ~
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-4.0.12.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-4.0.12.tar.gz
$ cd redis-4.0.12
$ make
```

#### Install zcashd

First install the following dependency so you can talk to zcash repository using HTTPS:

```sh
$ sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https wget gnupg2
```

Next add the Zcash master signing key to apt's trusted keyring:

```sh
$ wget -qO - https://apt.z.cash/zcash.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

`Key fingerprint = 3FE6 3B67 F85E A808 DE9B  880E 6DEF 3BAF 2727 66C0`

Add the repository to your sources:

```sh
$ echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.z.cash/ jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zcash.list
```

Finally, update the cache of sources and install Zcash:

```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y zcash
```

In order to connect to the test network, you can use this command to create `zcash.conf` in ~/.zcash directory:

```sh
$ echo -e "testnet=1
addnode=testnet.z.cash
rpcuser=yourZcashNodeUsername
rpcpassword=yourZcashNodePassword" > ~/.zcash/zcash.conf
```

In order to connect to the main network, you can use this command to create `zcash.conf` in ~/.zcash directory:

```sh
$ echo -e "addnode=mainnet.z.cash
rpcuser=yourZcashNodeUsername
rpcpassword=yourZcashNodePassword" > ~/.zcash/zcash.conf
```

Make sure to change "yourZcashNodeUsername" and "yourZcashNodePassword" in the aforementioned file after creating it. You can use:

```sh
$ nano ~/.zcash/zcash.conf
```

When you're done press CTRL + X, type "y" and press Enter.

You can now run Zcash Daemon (Node) by typing:
```sh
$ zcashd
```

Wait until the Zcash Daemon has downloaded all the blocks and proceed to the next step.

### Running Pool

Our example config has default ports for redis-server and zcashd.

Create config.json by copying config.example.json:

```sh
$ cd ~/open-zcash-pool
$ cp config.example.json config.json
```

After editing config.json, run the pool using:

```sh
$ ./build/bin/open-zcash-pool config.json
```

```

### Building Frontend

Install nodejs. I suggest using LTS version >= 4.x from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions or from your Linux distribution or simply install nodejs on Ubuntu 16.04.

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.

```sh
$ cd www
```

Change <code>ApiUrl: '//example.net/'</code> in <code>www/config/environment.js</code> to match your domain name. Also don't forget to adjust other options.

You might have to run commands with "-g" with sudo.

```sh
$ npm install -g ember-cli@2.9.1
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ ./build.sh
```

Configure nginx to serve API on <code>/api</code> subdirectory.
Configure nginx to serve <code>www/dist</code> as static website.

#### Serving API using nginx

Create an upstream for API:

```
upstream api {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
}
```

and add this setting after <code>location /</code>:

```
location /api {
    proxy_pass http://api;
}
```

#### Customization

You can customize the layout using built-in web server with live reload:

```sh
$ ember server --port 8082 --environment development
```

**Don't use built-in web server in production**.

Check out <code>www/app/templates</code> directory and edit these templates
in order to customise the frontend.
